# imdb_horror_query

Hi there!

I'm actually studying to become a data engineer.
One of my teacher, challenge us with a task to get a list of all the horror movies produced from the year 2000 to 2010 (inclusive) that have a imdb rating higher or equal to 6.
The only tool given was this link to the imdb datasets : https://datasets.imdbws.com/ .
