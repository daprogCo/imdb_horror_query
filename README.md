# imdb_horror_query

Hi!

I'm currently studying to become a data engineer. One of my teachers has challenged us with a task: to retrieve a list of all horror movies produced between the years 2000 and 2010 (inclusive) that have an IMDb rating equal to or higher than 6. The only tool provided for this task is the following link to the IMDb datasets: https://datasets.imdbws.com/.
